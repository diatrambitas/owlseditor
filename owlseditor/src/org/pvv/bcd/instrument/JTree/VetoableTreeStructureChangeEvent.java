/**
 * <p>
 * The event object for a tree structure change. Listeners to this
 * event type have the power to veto the change, in which case it
 * will not happen.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In an unfortunate turn of events (some would call it a design glitch,
 * others will fess up and call it laziness), this event class is used
 * for two distinct types of tree structure changes. For each of these
 * two, some of our properties will make sense and others should be
 * ignored. This is how it works;
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * When a node is renamed, an event is filled in with its
 * <code>oldName</code>, <code>newName</code>, <code>source</code>
 * and <code>node</code> properties set. All others should be ignored
 * as they will generally by <code>null</code> or zero or somesuch.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * When a node is moved, an event is filled in with its
 * <code>oldParent</code>, <code>oldIndex</code>,
 * <code>newParent</code>, <code>newIndex</code>,
 * <code>source</code> and <code>node</code> properties set.
 * All others should be ignored
 * as they will generally by <code>null</code> or zero or somesuch.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * @todo Split this into two events, one "Node Moved" event and one
 * "Node Renamed" event.
 *
 * @todo We need a set of events that are <em>not</em> vetoable
 * and that get fired after the vetoable events if the change
 * actually took place. As it is now, early receivers of these events
 * have no way of knowing whether or not later receivers will veto
 * them and so don't really know whether it is happening or not.
