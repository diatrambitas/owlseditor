/**
 * Interface to implement for anyone who wants to be notified of tree structure
 * changes. It is also possible to veto these events, which can be great fun.
 * 
 * @todo We need a set of events that are <em>not</em> vetoable and that get
 *       fired after the vetoable events if the change actually took place. As
 *       it is now, early receivers of these events have no way of knowing
 *       whether or not later receivers will veto them and so don't really know
 *       whether it is happening or not.
