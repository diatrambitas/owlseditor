When drag-and-dropping within same tree, operation is carried out as first an
Add then a Delete. It should be optimized into a Move. One bad side effect with
the current way is that DnD operations trying to move a node within its own
parent and that result in a VetoException get undone when most of the time,
the node should simply have changed indexes within its parent. Some
head-scratching is in order over the code in TreeDropTargetListener.drop().

Implement DND export of text with subtrees, tabs etc. Implement DND import of
text with subtrees, tabs, etc.

When VetoException causes Undo, the UndoManager generates a corresponding Redo.
This should be suppressed.

When VetoException is caught, it generally gets ignored. There should be an
option for an action to be taken when this happens. Beep, status message, log
event, etc., are possible options.

Instrumenter.addNode(boolean, Object) and
Instrumenter.addChildNode(boolean, Object)
contain much identical code. The common code should be moved into a separate
method called by both.
